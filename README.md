# Quiz System Version1 

## Summer CPSC 210 

#### Project Overview

This simple quiz system will meet the following specification guidelines:

- Allow users to input textual representations of questions
- Assign each questions a unique point or numerical value
- Assign a correct answer to each question 
- Grade an arbitrary student's responses and provide feedback on the correct answer  

#### Motivation
Having taken many online quizzes
through university and high school, 
I seek to replicate and learn from the 
functionality of these versatile systems.
Effective quiz programs hosted on educational platforms 
such as *Canvas* and *McGraw Hill Ryerson* play a pivotal 
role in Higher education. Without such systems,
student testing would be far more inefficient. 
As I strive to optimize and automate impractical
everyday tasks, I hope that I can learn from this classic example
and better identify areas where automation can ease the
lives of others. 

#### User Interaction 
Primary users of this quiz system would include **teaching professionals**and 
**smaller educational institutions**. By implementing this system, users will
save time grading assessments and be able to provide automated 
feedback to a large group of students in a short amount of time. 
The use of this system is limited and intended for smaller
organizations where the number of test questions and their variations
is limited.  

#### User Stories
+ As a user, I want to add questions(x) into my quiz (y)

+ As a user, I want to add up to 26 multiple choice options for each question
+ As a user, I want to assign a correct response to a quiz for it to be marked
+ As a user, I want to have printed layout after my quiz has been made

#### Phase 2 Update
New user stories include the following: 
+ As a user, I want to have the option of saving the quiz to store it after exiting 
application. 
+ As a user, when I start the application I want to have the option of loading 
and having a printed layout of my prior quiz 

#### Phase 3 Update 
The following are instructions for the grader to follow:
+ To initially create a new quiz press the key "a"
+ Each consecutive question can be added by pressing the key "a" and filling in the appropriate field
